     * A basic implementation of a disjoint-set data structure for maintaining a
     * collection of disjoint dynamic sets. This is based on the algorithm
     * description in Chapter 21 of 'Introduction to Algorithm 2nd Edition' (by
     * Cormen, Leriserson, Rivest, and Stein) for Disjoint-sets taking into account
     * some of the heuristic ideas described. However, this implementation relies on
     * the constant time performance of the HashMap's get and put operations, and
     * HashSet's add, remove, contains and size operations as an alternative
     * implementation approach. This provides a cleaner separation between the
     * elements and the implementation (i.e. the idea of a representative for a
     * particular disjoint set is not used) and an easier to use API (i.e. direct
     * access to the disjoint set that an element belongs to and no need to
     * understand how the internals work with respect to a representative) but will
     * not perform as fast (proper analysis required but likely O(m + n lg n) as
     * detailed in Theorem 21.1 on page 504 of 'Introduction to Algorithm 2nd
     * Edition').
     * 
     * Note: the internal implementation of this class can likely be improved to use
     * all the techniques outlined in section 21.3 in order to get optimal
     * performance.
