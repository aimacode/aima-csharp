     * An online search problem must be solved by an agent executing actions, rather
     * than by pure computation. We assume a deterministic and fully observable
     * environment (Chapter 17 relaxes these assumptions), but we stipulate that the
     * agent knows only the following: <br>
     * <ul>
     * <li>ACTIONS(s), which returns a list of actions allowed in state s;</li>
     * <li>The step-cost function c(s, a, s') - note that this cannot be used until
     * the agent knows that s' is the outcome; and</li>
     * <li>GOAL-TEST(s).</li>
     * </ul>
