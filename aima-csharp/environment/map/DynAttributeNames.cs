     * The AIMA framework uses dynamic attributes to make implementations of agents

     * this concept is, that it's error-prone. This set of constants is designed to
     * make information exchange more reliable for map agents. Two kinds of
     * attributes are distinguished. Percept attributes are attached to percepts.
     * They are generated by the environment and read by by the agent.
     * EnvironmentState attributes are attached to the EnvironmentState of the
     * Environment.
